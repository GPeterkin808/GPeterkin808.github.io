    <h1> Gabe's 30 Day Dance Program: Functional Flava </h1>
    <h2>About The Program:</h2>
    <p> Hello! My name is Gabriel Peterkin, and I am the creator behind Functional Flava - the 30-Day Dance Program taking the
        world by storm! Meant for beginners, this program is designed to introduce the essentials, fundamentals, and necessities of modern dance styles.
        In four weeks, concepts such as footwork, isolations, flava (essentially the style and swagger behind the moves) and so much more will be covered.
        Careful consideration and thought was placed into progression of the program, with multiple step-by-step tutorials for all moves and choreography present.
        Featuring daily goals, tried-and-true warmup essions, and online live dance sessions and mentors, Functional Flava takes the guesswork and anxiety out of the
        dance equation, allowing you to focus on your flava.
        So many programs nowadays tend to say they are for beginners, but jump to intermediate level choreography and difficult air flares within a week or two.
        Functional Flava understands what it's like to try and become a new dancer and the fears associated with it. I'm here to tell you that you can become the dancer you've always dreamed
        to be, and to start by building a solid foundation with Functional Flava.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        The reason I created Functional Flava is simply because I'm passionate about it. When I dance, I feel comfortable, happy, and serene, as it should be. To bust out a clean move at that party
        or to kill that one piece of choreography you've been trying to learn is more important than many people realize. However, time and time again, I've seen people never get to those places
        simply because they're too embarassed or anxious to dance in the first place. It takes a lot to be comfortable with how you move and even more so for hen people start to take notice and watch.
        I don't want that for anyone, so I decided to pour my time and energy into a near-perfect guide on not only how to dance, but how to get your flava.

    <h2>In-Depth Program:</h2>
    <h3>Week 1: The Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>
        We begin with the essentials of dance. Footwork, mindset, and musicality are the topics are focused on during this week. Simple moves such as the Arm Wave and Chest Pop are also taught.
    </p>
    <h3>Week 2: Fluidity: Popping & Locking</h3>

    <p>
        The history of popping and locking is a crucial one to any good dancer. The quick flex and release of the muscles is taught to show the basics of how dancers like Fik-Shun and Michael Jackson came to be.

    <p>
        My favorite week focuses on grooves, cool moves, and an exhibition of flava. Swag is necessary here, so be ready for the most crucial week.

    <p>
        Just like a bomb, this week focuses on the tics and booms of dance. Know when to be sharp and when to be powerful. The seamless switching in between the two is what made Les Twins, and it can make you too.
